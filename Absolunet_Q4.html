<!-- Option A is better semantically because it is clearer and more straightforward.
The <section>, <header>, and <footer> tags all have semantic value and the use of non-semantic 
tags in this option is kept to a minimum. 
  
For Option B, <div> and <span> are not semantic elements as they do not describe 
their meaning to the browser and/or developer. The use of these tags, even with classes,
does not provide the semantic clarity found in Option A. On the contrary, I would suggest 
that they clutter up the code and make it more challenging to parse out what's actually happening!
